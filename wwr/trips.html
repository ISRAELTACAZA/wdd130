            <p> The Apurimac river (Speaker of the Gods) or (means “the oracle”) in the native Inca Language, is the
                most direct source of the Amazon River, making it the longest river in the world. It has different
                sections, some of
                them are very good for rafting. This river rafting is rated among the 10 best rafting trips in the
                world. We start the trip
                in Cusco at 3,400 mts altitude and drive down to the canyon at 2200 meters. So, the weather is much
                warmer. <br>
